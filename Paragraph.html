      People say that love is a stunning thing, but they fail to understand the
      challenges that face true love. True love is unconditional, patient, kind,
      and chronic despite the challenges that one faces while experiences true
      love. As one explores the affection of actual love, numerous challenges
      face a couple throughout their relationship which proceeds to marriage
      life. Based on personal experience, many troubles such as loss of friends,
      disagreements between couples, and the couple faces rejection from family,
      relatives, and friends due to jealous faces real love; hence, the firm
      believes that the trip for true love is challenging as opposed to being
      smooth. While pursuing genuine love individual's face many obstacles to
      some extent one lose hope and think of giving up, but the forces of love
      enable the individual to confront the obstacle (Bates-Batcheller 173). For
      example, in the A Midsummer's Night Dream, Hegit rmia and Lysander are
      faced with a barrier because Hermia father does not approve their
      marriage, but as a result of the fears of her father's death curse she
      foregoes the love of her life Lysander and marries Demetrius who she does
      not love (Klitgaar 10). Later, elopes with the love of his life after
      which they marry each other. In the day to day love life, couple face
      disagreements from their parents regarding their choice of who to love and
      marry, and in the case where true love exist the individuals proceed with
      their love life irrespective of their close family members of friends
      failing to approve the person's love or marriage partner.

      True love brings about fulfillment which in turn enables the lovers to
      cope with the obstacles that they face, and the couples viewed as blind to
      the challenges that they are faces such as misjudgment and jealousy
      (Bates-Batcheller 173). Whenever a person is happy with their partner,
      other people are thinking carefully about how they will bring the couple
      down and break their relationship which is an act of jealousy. True love
      comes along with many complications which affect the couples as well as
      the people around them, and, hence, in some cases, the couples in love
      have to face challenges arising from the people surrounding them which in
      turn may influence their decision regarding their relationship.

      In some instances, true love is viewed as magical, forces that individual
      in love cannot explain nor overcome. When people are in love and are
      experiencing the true love, they are easily carried away by each other,
      and to some extent, they seem not to reason. In the play Midsummerâ€™s Night
      Dream, many characters take uninformed decisions as a result of affection.
      For example, Despite Hermia being warned not to marry the love of her life
      as he was not her father's choice, both Hermia and Lysander of them elopes
      without fearing that Hermia might die as a result of disobeying her
      father's will (Klitgaar 12). Secondly, Helena is ready to betray her
      friend Hermia by telling Demetrius her escape plan in an attempto get
      closer to him so as to rebuild their lost love (Klitgaar 15). In these two
      instances, the ladies make uninformed decisions without focusing on their
      consequences due to the irresistible driving force associated with love.
      Despite the fact that the decisions have adverse impacts on the characters
      they are ready to suffer for the sake of true love.

      Based on this argument it is evidence that the road to true love has never
      been and will never be smooth. In the day to day life, people have to make
      decisions marriage and relationship decisions which have consequences as a
      result of pursuing true love.
